ICNS is an open internet service built on the Internet Computer blockchain. The core protocol maps human-readable names to machine-readable crypto addresses and other customized user metadata, helping to remove the burden of memorizing crypto addresses. **Your ICNS name will be your passport to the Web3 ecosystem.**

## üìö Documentation

Looking to get ICNS-js setup in your project? The ICNS docs are your best bet!

Get started with our documentation ‚û°Ô∏è [here](https://www.notion.so/icns-id/ICNS-js-Docs-29262b91ef334b39b2416fd46de45a6e).

## üì• Installation 

ICNS-js can be installed locally from our Github repository. To do so you're going to need a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the following configurations:

- **repo**
- **read:packages**

Next, authenticate yourself via `npm login` command using your Github email for the **username** and the **personal access token** as your **password:**

```bash
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --scope=@psychedelic
```

The last thing we‚Äôve got to do before installing is set your npm configuration so that when you run `npm install @psychedelic/`, npm will pull from Github instead of its own registry.

To do this, **we have two options:**

1) Run the following command
```bash
npm config set @psychedelic:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

2) Add a `.npmrc` file to your project's root directory and add the following line to the file:

```bash
@psychedelic:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

You're all set! Install Sonic-js into your project with the following command:

```bash
yarn add @psychedelic/sonic-js
```
